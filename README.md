### timetree_viewer -- tree visualization in the browser based on [nextflu/auspice](https://github.com/blab/nextflu/)
This is very much work in progress. The aim is to develop a set of javascript objects that can be used to display phylogenetic trees in the web browser and provide decorate those trees with meta information.


#### Usage
 * compile styles with `lessc`
 * `index.html`, `tree.json`, `sequences.json` are provided as examples. Open the `index.html` in a browser. 
 * most customization should be done in `js/auspice.js`
